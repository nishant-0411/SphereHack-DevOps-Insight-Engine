# Prototypes Directory

This directory contains quick experiments, proof-of-concepts, and technology evaluations.

## Current Prototypes

*No prototypes yet - this is where creative experiments will live*

## Prototype Categories

### Technology Evaluations
- New framework experiments
- Library comparisons
- Performance benchmarks
- Integration tests

### Feature Prototypes
- UI/UX mockups
- API design experiments
- Database schema tests
- Algorithm implementations

### Integration Experiments
- Third-party service tests
- Webhook implementations
- Real-time communication
- Authentication flows

## Prototype Guidelines

1. **Keep it Simple**: Focus on proving one concept at a time
2. **Document Learnings**: Include README with findings
3. **Time-boxed**: Limit experiments to avoid over-engineering
4. **Disposable**: Prototypes are for learning, not production
