# Feature Specifications

This directory contains detailed specifications for features following the requirements → design → tasks workflow.

## Specification Structure

Each feature specification includes:

### `requirements.md`
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- EARS-compliant requirements
- Glossary of terms
- Testable specifications

### `design.md`
- System architecture
- Component interfaces
- Data models
- Correctness properties for testing
- Error handling strategy

### `tasks.md`
- Implementation task breakdown
- Property-based test tasks
- Integration checkpoints
- Requirements traceability

## Creating New Specifications

1. **Choose a Feature**: Identify what you want to build
2. **Start with Requirements**: Define user needs and acceptance criteria
3. **Design the Solution**: Architecture, interfaces, and correctness properties
4. **Plan Implementation**: Break down into executable tasks

## Suggested First Specifications

Based on your current application, consider creating specs for:

- [ ] **Real-time Deployment Monitoring**: WebSocket-based live updates
- [ ] **Multi-Platform Orchestration**: Deploy to multiple platforms simultaneously
- [ ] **Team Collaboration**: Shared workspaces and permissions
- [ ] **Deployment Analytics**: Performance metrics and insights
- [ ] **Automated Rollbacks**: Smart failure detection and recovery
- [ ] **CLI Tools**: Command-line deployment management

## Specification Quality

Good specifications should:
- ✅ Use EARS patterns for requirements
- ✅ Include testable acceptance criteria
- ✅ Define correctness properties
- ✅ Break down into actionable tasks
- ✅ Reference user needs clearly
- ✅ Consider error conditions
- ✅ Plan for testing strategy
